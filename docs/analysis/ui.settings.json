  "ui.settings.IconSizeSettingsPanel": {
    "IconSizeSettingsPanel(ConfigManager)": "Constructor for the 'UI' tab in the settings window. It creates a `JPanel` that allows the user to configure the application's icon size. It initializes a `JSpinner` with the valid icon sizes obtained from `ScalingConverter`. The panel's state is initialized with the current value from `ConfigManager`. This class is instantiated by `SettingsAction` when the settings window is opened.",
    "handleSave()": "This private method is the `ActionListener` for the 'Save' button. It retrieves the value from the `JSpinner`, validates it by finding the nearest supported size using `resolveNearestSize`, and then updates the `UiSettings` within the `AppSettings` object. Finally, it calls `configManager.saveSettings()` to persist the change. It provides feedback to the user via a status label, indicating success or failure. This is the core logic for persisting UI settings.",
    "resolveNearestSize(int)": "A private utility method that takes a user-requested icon size and finds the closest valid size from the list of pre-processed, supported sizes. This ensures that the user's selection always maps to a set of icons that actually exist on disk, preventing errors in the detection engine. It iterates through the `supportedSizes` array and returns the one with the minimum absolute difference from the requested size."
  },
  "ui.settings.HotkeySettingsPanel": {
    "HotkeySettingsPanel(ConfigManager)": "Constructor for the 'Hotkeys' tab in the settings window. It builds a complex `JPanel` that displays a table of all available hotkey actions. For each action, it shows the default binding and provides a text field and checkbox for the user to set and enable a custom binding. It dynamically creates a `Row` for each binding found in the `HotkeySettings`. This is instantiated by `SettingsAction`.",
    "handleSave()": "The `ActionListener` for the 'Save hotkeys' button. It iterates through each `Row` in the UI, retrieves the custom binding string from the text field, and calls `parseCustomBindings` to validate and parse it into the required format for `settings.json`. If all custom bindings are valid, it updates the `HotkeySettings` object and calls `configManager.saveSettings()`. If any binding is invalid, it highlights the field and displays an error message.",
    "parseCustomBindings(String, String)": "A private validation and parsing method. It takes the raw string from a custom hotkey text field (e.g., 'CTRL + SHIFT + F1, ALT + F2') and splits it into individual key sequences. For each sequence, it performs a series of validation checks: it must contain exactly one non-modifier key and at least one modifier. If valid, it converts the sequence into a `List<List<String>>` format that matches the schema of `settings.json`. If invalid, it returns a descriptive error message.",
    "KeyCapturePopup.dispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent)": "The core method of the private inner `KeyCapturePopup` class. It's a `KeyEventDispatcher`, meaning it intercepts all key events while the popup is visible. It ignores key releases and modifiers pressed alone. When a valid combination (modifiers + a final key) is pressed, it calls `translateEvent` to convert the `KeyEvent` into a list of string tokens, passes this list to the completion callback, and closes itself. It also handles the ESC key to cancel the capture."
