  "Main": {
    "main(String[])": "The main entry point of the application, orchestrating the entire startup sequence. It is responsible for initializing all core components in the correct order: it loads configurations, populates the image template cache, sets up the screen capture and detection engine, parses and activates the user-selected ability sequence, initializes the hotkey manager, and finally, sets up the Swing taskbar UI. It also registers a crucial shutdown hook to ensure graceful resource cleanup. Dependencies are numerous, calling nearly every major manager and service. Failures during initialization are logged and can halt the application.",
    "populateTemplateCache()": "This method initializes the static `templateCache`. Its purpose is to load the correctly scaled ability icon templates from the filesystem before the detection engine needs them. It reads the desired icon size from the `ConfigManager` settings, then asks the `ConfigManager` to resolve the path to the best-matching pre-scaled icon subfolder. It instantiates the `TemplateCache` with this path, which triggers the synchronous loading of all images. This method is called by `main` during startup. A failure to find an exact size match results in a fallback, which could impact detection accuracy.",
    "populateSettings()": "This is a critical first step in the application's startup sequence, responsible for initializing the static `ConfigManager`. It instantiates the manager and calls its `initialize()` method, which handles loading all settings from JSON files or creating default files if they don't exist. This method is called by `main`. Any `IOException` during this process is wrapped in a `RuntimeException`, which will terminate the application startup, as no other component can function without the configuration."
